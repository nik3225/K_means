# K_means
1.  The file shows the usage of the kmeans algorithm to cluster the data. We have labelled data in the given scenario whereas it is not the  case in an unsupervised algorithm.
2.  Using these labels we can see that our model gives out substantial accuracy based on just the features.
3.  note here that we are not using the labels when we are trying to derive the answers instead they are just used to check the accuracy.
